# pi-snek
A snake game made on Raspberry Pi using GPIO button input for controls. My first attempt at using GPIO and button inputs in a project. Snake game modified from the 'Snake Game in Python' tutorial found on GeeksforGeeks. 

#### The Game
The game code is from the Snake Game in Python tutorial on GeeksforGeeks found at [Snake Game in Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/snake-game-in-python-using-pygame-module/). I modified it to handle the button inputs. I also made the speed change as the player goes through the game and the fruit colour randomizes for each spawn. The game is built with the pygame library.

#### The Buttons
I used the Raspberry Pi 4 along with a breadboard and four buttons to make the controller. [Here is what it looked like](/images/pisnek-hardware.jpg)
